                              O R D E R
           Application for permission to file review petition is
allowed.
           We have carefully perused the Review Petition and the
connected papers.    We are convinced that the order against which
review has been sought, does not suffer from any error apparent,
warranting its reconsideration.
           The Review Petition is, accordingly, dismissed.
