Application for impleadment as petitioners  is
allowed.
Delay condoned.
Having  considered  the  matter,  we  are  of  the
view that the interest of justice  would be served if
the  State  is  directed  to  consider  all  those
candidates who become ineligible because of age limit
in  the  next  recruitment  process  as  and  when  it
occurs.  We order accordingly.
The  candidates  may  pursue  their  remedies  in
law  in relation to (i) discontinuance and (ii) pay
scales).
The  special  leave  petitions  are  disposed  of
accordingly.
