KURIAN, J.
Delay condoned.
2. Leave granted.
3. Mr.   Mushtaq   Ahmad,   learned   counsel,   appears   and
accepts notice for the sole respondent.
4. In the nature of order we propose to pass in this
matter,   it   may   not   be   proper   for   this   Court   at   this
stage to express anything on the merits of the case.
5. However,   suffice   it   to   note   that   the   appellant
has   approached   this   Court,   aggrieved   by   a   direction
issued by the Court to comply with the interim order.
Compliance   would   mean   that   the   appellant/University
Grants   Commission   (UGC)   will   have   to   change   the
status   of   the   respondent/University   to   a   State
University.     It   is   submitted   by   the   learned   counsel
for   the   appellant   that   as   of   now   it   is   shown   as   a
private university.
6. Since   the   main   writ   petition   is   pending
consideration before the High Court, having heard the
counsel   on   both   the   sides,   we   are   of   the   view   that
status   quo   as   on   today   shall   be   maintained   by   the
parties   till   the   writ   petition   is   disposed   of.
Ordered accordingly.
7. The appeals are, accordingly, disposed of.

8. We make it clear that we have not considered the
merits of the matter.
9. Pending   application(s),   if   any,   shall   stand
disposed of.
10. There shall be no orders as to costs.
