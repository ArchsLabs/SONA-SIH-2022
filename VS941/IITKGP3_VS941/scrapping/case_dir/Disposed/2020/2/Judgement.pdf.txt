CIVIL APPEAL NO. 0092 OF 2020
(Arising out of SLP (C) No. 8965 of 2018)
ZIAUDDIN HASSAN                                    … Appellant
VERSUS
UNIVERSITY OF DELHI & ORS.                         … Respondents
O R D E R
Having  heard  learned  counsel  for  the  parties  and  having
perused the records, we are of the opinion that the High Court
could have considered the writ petition in its entirety in one go.
By  the  impugned  order,  prayers  ‘a’  and  ‘b’  of  the  writ
petition are rejected on the ground of delay and latches whereas
prayers ‘c’ and ‘d’ are kept alive to be considered at the time of
final hearing.  Prima facie, it appears that the prayer ‘d’ may be
dependent on prayer ‘a’ also.  Be that as it may, since we find
that the matter has to be heard by the High Court in its entirety,
we direct the High Court to do so.
We  make  it  clear  that  the  aspect  of  delay  of  11  years  in
filing the writ petition also is kept open to be considered by the
High Court once again.  We have not made any observations on merits
as well as on the aspect of delay.
The appeal is, accordingly, disposed of.
