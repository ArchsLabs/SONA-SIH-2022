          UPON hearing the counsel the Court made the following
                             O R D E R
Writ Petition (Civil) being No. 25995/2018 has been disposed
of by the Allahabad High Court on the footing that a petition filed
by the College is pending in the Supreme Court.  The basis of the
order  is  incorrect  for  the  reason  that  on  28.11.2017  a  Writ
Petition (Civil) being No. 445/2017 was disposed of by this Court
finally.  It will thus not open to petitioner to file an IA in the
pending proceedings, since nothing is pending.  
This being so, we set aside the High Court judgment and remand
the matter to the Allahabad High Court.  Given the fact that time
is running out, we request the High Court to take up the petition
and dispose of the same on merits within a period of four weeks
from today.  All contentions from all sides are left open.
The Special Leave Petition is disposed of accordingly.   
Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of.
