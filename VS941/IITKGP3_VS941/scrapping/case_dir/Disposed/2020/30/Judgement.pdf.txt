INHERENT JURISDICTION 
SUO MOTO TRANSFER PETITION (C) NOS.2-3/2020
IN REG : LETTER DATED 03.03.2020 RECEIVED FROM HIGH COURT OF 
SIKKIM
O R D E R 
We  have  heard  learned  counsel  appearing  for  the
parties and perused the letter dated 03.03.2020 received
from the Hon'ble Chief Justice of Sikkim High Court. 
The said letter reveals that two writ appeals viz.,
W.A. No.1/2020 titled as "Sikkim Manipal University Vs.
Union  of  India  &  Others,  and  W.A.  No.2/2020  titled  as
"Shri  Anoop  Raghu  Shetty  Vs.  Union  of  India  &  Others,
have been preferred against the judgment and order dated
03.01.2020  passed  by  Mrs.  Justice  Meenakshi  Madan  Rai,
Judge,  High  Court  of  Sikkim  in  Writ  Petition  (C)
No.65/2016,  before  the  said  High  Court.  During  the
pendency of the said writ petition, Hon'ble Mr. Justice
Bhaskar Raj Pradhan had recused himself from hearing the
matter. 
It is further stated that since there are only two
puisne  Judges  in  the  Sikkim  High  Court,  it  is  not
possible to constitute a Division Bench to hear the said
writ appeals. 
In the circumstances, we consider it appropriate in
the interests of justice to transfer the aforesaid writ
