Ms. Nidhi Mittal, Adv. 
          UPON hearing the counsel the Court made the following
                             O R D E R
The petitioners filed a writ petition in the High Court of
Jharkhand at Ranchi for quashing the notice dated 06.11.2020 issued
by the Office of the ADG (ME), Government of India, Directorate
General  of  Health  Services,  Medical  Counselling  Committee,  New
Delhi by which the petitioner was removed from the Seat Matrix for
the first round of counselling of undergraduate  seats being held
in pursuance to the NEET-2020 examination. The High Court issued
notice in the writ petition but refused to pass an interim order as
prayed  for  by  the  petitioners.  The  petitioners  approached  this
Court by filing the instant special leave petition with a grievance
that an interim order ought to have been passed by the High Court.
 Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, learned senior counsel submitted that the
petitioner is governed by the UGC(Institutions of Eminence Deemed
to be Universities) Regulations, 2017 and have been recognised as
institutions of eminence. Mr. Rohatgi, further submitted that the
admission sought by the petitioner is at the off-campus centre at
Bairdih, Jamshedpur. The argument of the learned senior counsel for
the petitioner is that the other deemed universities governed by
the UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2019
are permitted to have off-campus centres and there is no reason why
an institution of eminence should not be permitted to have an off-
campus center. 
3
Mr.  Sanjay Jain, learned ASG submitted that the Government of
India  has  to  seek  a  proposal  from  the  UGC  for  permitting  the
Institutions of Eminence Deemed to be Universities to have off-
campus  centers  and  the  proposal  is  under  consideration.  The
submission of the learned ASG is that as on date the institutions
of eminence are not permitted to have off-campus centers and so the
action of the ADG(ME), Government of India, Directorate General of
Health Services, Medical Counselling Committee, New Delhi excluding
the  petitioners  from  the  Seat  Matrix  for  the  first  round  of
counselling of undergraduate seats is proper. 
After  hearing  the  learned  counsel  for  the  parties,  without
expressing any opinion on the merits of the writ petition that is
pending  before  the  High  Court,  we  are  of  the  opinion  that  the
petitioner should be included in the Seat Matrix for the second
round of counselling of undergraduate seats which is going on at
present and students may be allotted to the petitioner. 
 
The above direction is subject to the final decision in the
writ petition. 
The  petitioner  shall  inform  the  students  at  the  time  of
counselling  who  are  admitted  in  its  institution  that  their
admission would be subject to the decision in the writ petition. 
The Special Leave Petition stands disposed of. 
4
Pending  application(s),  if  any,  stands  disposed  of
accordingly.
