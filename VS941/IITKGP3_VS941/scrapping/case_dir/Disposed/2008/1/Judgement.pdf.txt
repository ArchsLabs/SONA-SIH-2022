O R D E R
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
It is stated that as the appellant had retired and
his claim for counting three years of service for pension
is not disputed by the State which is to give the pension.
Accordingly, we make it clear that the impugned order will
not stand in the way of State of Kerala for counting the
said service for pension.
The appeal is, accordingly, disposed of. No costs.
