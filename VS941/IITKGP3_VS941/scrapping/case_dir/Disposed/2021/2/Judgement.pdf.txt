UPON hearing the counsel the Court made the following
                              O R D E R
1
The Special Leave Petitions arise out of an interim order of a Division Bench of
the High Court of Karnataka dated 2 December 2020 in Writ Appeal Nos 549 and
550 of 2020.
2
Taking note of the fact that for academic year 2020-21, 132 out of 252 seats had
been ‘counseled’ by the Directorate General of Health Service1, the High Court,
“in the interest of uniformity and parity”, ordered that the balance 118 seats be

also counseled by the DGHS.  At the present point of time, this interim order of
the High Court has worked itself out for academic year 2020-21.
3
Mr Nikhil Goel, learned AAG appearing on behalf of the petitioners, however,
submits that this interim order of the Division Bench does not take cognizance of
the fact that a mandamus had been issued by the order of the learned Single
Judge dated 3 November 2020 as a result of which the notification issued by the
Central  Government,  by  which  the  College  was  included  in  the  ambit  of  a
deemed  university  outside  the  State  of  Karnataka  was  quashed.   Learned
counsel  submits  that  the  interim  order  of  the  High  Court  has  incorrectly
proceeded on the basis that the notification dated 14 February 2019 continues
to hold the field.  Moreover, it has been submitted that though as many as five
orders have been passed after the impugned order for rectification of office
objections, the appellants in the writ appeal have not done so, as a result of
which the writ appeal cannot be heard expeditiously.  In the meantime, the same
problem is (it is apprehended) liable to be recurred for the ensuing academic
year.
4
Mr G Umapathy, learned counsel, has entered appearance on behalf of the first
respondent, on caveat.
5
Having heard Mr Nikhil Goel and Mr G Umapathy, we are of the considered view
that at this stage the interference of this Court with the interlocutory order of the
High Court is not warranted.  However, it is in public interest, bearing in mind
the education and careers of the students that the writ appeals are taken up by
the High Court expeditiously so as to obviate any complications arising in the
admissions for the ensuing academic year.
6
We accordingly request the High Court to issue peremptory directions within two
weeks of the receipt of a certified copy of this order for the removal of office
3
objections so that the writ appeals can be made ready for final disposal, if the
objections have still not been removed.
7
Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the first respondent has stated that the
writ appeals are listed for hearing on 5 July 2021.  We request the High Court to
take up the writ appeals expeditiously bearing in mind the need to resolve the
controversy so as to bring clarity to the admission process for academic year
2020-21.
8
The Special Leave Petitions are accordingly disposed of.
9
Pending application, if any, stands disposed of.
