                                 VERSUS

O R D E R
Issue Rule.
Though   manifold   prayers   have   been   made,   yet   in   this   writ
petition   preferred   by   three   students   who   had   prosecuted   their
studies in the B.Sc. online course from the Himgiri Zee University,
the   4 th
  respondent   herein,   two   basic   reliefs   are   required   to   be
dealt with:-
(i) The   degrees   have   not   been   issued   by   the   4 th
  respondent-
University   and   in   case   they   are   issued,   they   should   not   be
treated as invalid degrees; and
(ii) The   University   must   be   commanded   to   close   all   the   online   and
offshore courses.
On   being   asked,   Mr.   Ravinder   Agarwal,   learned   counsel
appearing   for   the   University   Grants   Commission,   submitted   that
after   issuance   of   notice   by   the   University   Grants   Commission,   the
4 th
  respondent   has   closed   the   offshore   courses.     It   is   his
2
submission that online courses are also required to be stopped.
Mr. Sanjay  R. Hegde,  learned senior  counsel appearing  for the
respondent no.8, who was the Ex. Vice-Chancellor of the University
submitted   that   the   University   is   not   entitled   to   carry   on   either
online   courses   or   offshore   courses   or   establish   any   campus   beyond
the State of Uttarakhand.  
At   this   juncture,   Mr.   Sridhar   Potaraju,   learned   counsel
appearing   for   the   University   submitted   that   the   University   has
already   closed   the   online   courses   and   offshore   courses   and   it
shall   not   open   any   campus   beyond   the   territory   of   the   State   of
Uttarakhand.
We hereby make it clear that the University shall work within
the   boundaries   of   law.     When   we   say   within   the   boundaries   of   law,
it means that it has to run its courses in accord with the approval
of the University Grants Commission.  Whatever has been stated here
are  to  be  treated  as  a  writ  of  mandamus  issued  by  this  Court.    If
the   University   deviates   from   any   of   the   directions   passed   herein,
it shall face the consequences.
As three students have the grievance and apprehension that the
degrees,   if   issued   by   the   4 th
  respondent   University,   shall   not   be
recognized   by   all   the   Universities,   we   asked   Mr.   Ravinder   garwal,
learned   counsel  appearing   for  the   University  Grants   Commission  who
submitted   unequivocally   that   the   degrees   shall   be   recognized   as
after   closer   of   the   offshore   campus   centres,   the   petitioners   have
been allowed to prosecute their studies in the University.
3
Learned counsel  for the  University says  that they  shall issue
the   degrees   within   four   weeks   hence   if   they   have   passed   the
examination.     The   degrees   issued   by   the   4 th
  respondent   shall   be
treated as valid.
With   the   aforesaid   direction,   the   writ   petition   stands
disposed of.  There shall be no order as to costs.
