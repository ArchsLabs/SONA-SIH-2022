          UPON hearing the counsel the Court made the following
                             O R D E R
When the benefit has been given of the pay scale on
01.01.2006,  the  persons  who  had  retired  up  to  26.02.2009
could not have been deprived of the benefit of revised salary
for purpose of pension which was to be paid to them.  In view
of  the  aforesaid  and  also  agreeing  with  the  reasoning
employed by the High Court, we are not inclined to interfere.
The special leave petitions are dismissed.
