     CORAM :             HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE A.K. SIKRI
                         HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE C. NAGAPPAN
     For Petitioner(s)                Mr. Maninder Singh, Sr. Adv.
                                      Mr. Manoj R. Sinha, Adv.
                                      Mr. T. Mahipal, Adv.
     For Respondent(s)                Mr. Ramesh P. Bhatt, Sr. Adv.
                                      Mr. Rutwik Panda, Adv.
                          UPON hearing the counsel the Court made the following
                                             O R D E R
                          Delay condoned.
                          In    the   peculiar   facts        of   this    case     when    th
e
                 University Grants Commission had sanctioned the amount for
                 the years 2007 and 2012 and even paid part amount against
                 the sanctioned amount, insofar as the direction of the High
                 Court in the impugned judgment to release the balance amount
                 for these two years is concerned, we are not inclined to
                 interfere with the same.

            However, we leave the question of law which is raised
    in    this    petition   open,   viz.,   whether   the   self-financing
    institution has any right to claim aid from the University
    Grants Commission.
            The      special    leave    petition      is    disposed    of
    accordingly.
