Heard learned counsel for the petitioner. 
In our  opinion, this  petition is  ill-advised being
premature. For, the authorities are yet to take appropri-
ate decision with regard to conduct of ensuing examina-
tions in the respective Boards.
If the decision of the concerned authorities is not
in accordance with the provisions of the Act, Rules and
applicable Regulations, it will be open to the aggrieved
persons to set up challenge in that regard, including as
representative petition, which can be considered on its
own merits.
The writ petition is dismissed accordingly. 
Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.
