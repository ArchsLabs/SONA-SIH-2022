For Respondent(s)                    
          UPON hearing the counsel the Court made the following
                             O R D E R
Delay condoned. 
By the impugned judgment and order, the High Court has 
ordered and directed as under-
“22. (1)  That Regulation 5.4 of the UGC Regulations
in so
far  as  it  permits  filling  of  M.Phil./Ph.D.
entirely on the basis of cent percent evaluation of
performance in the viva voce process is arbitrary. The
said  regulation  is,therefore,  declared  void  and
contrary to Article 14;
(2) The absence of any concession with respect to the
minimum qualifying marks in the written test, in the
UGC  Regulations  of  2016  to  reserved  category
candidates  (SC/ST/OBC)  and  physically  disabled
candidates is also without proper application of mind.
Appropriate  concession is to be given  by the UGC and

the JNU, taking into account the seats filled, having
regard to the implementation of the regulations in the
last two academic years;
(3) The JNU is directed to take suitable review action
to  ensure  that  in  any  given  academic  year,  no
M.Phil/Ph.d. seat is left unfilled.  It is also held
that the UGC guidelines of 2016 in so far as they
prescribe  the  supervisor-researcher/student  ratio  is
valid.”
Having heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
petitioner, no fault can be found with the directions issued
in terms of para 22 (1) and (2) and second part of para 22
(3), reproduced hereinabove.
Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner has
submitted that in view of first part of para 22(3),  namely,
the JNU is directed to take suitable review action to ensure
that in any given academic year, no M.Phil/Ph.d. seat is left
unfilled, is crating the problem  and in every academic year,
the Courts are directing to give admission even in the month
of January, that is much after the academic year starts.  It
is true that the aforesaid direction, namely, to ensure that
in  any  given  academic  year,  no  M.Phil/Ph.d.  seat  is  left
unfilled  can never be construed that the admission in the
unfilled  seat  is  to  be  given  even  at  the  fag  end  of  the
academic year.  The same may be construed to mean that the
University  to  ensure  that  in  any  given  academic  year,   no
M.Phil/Ph.d.  seat  is  left  unfilled  as  far  as  possible.  In
future,  if  any order is passed by the High Court and/or  any

other  Court  to grant admission after unreasonable period and
much after the academic terms has begun, it will always be
open  for  the   University  to  challenge  the  same  which  be
considered in accordance with law and on its own merits and in
the light of the observations made hereinabove. 
With the above observations, the Special Leave Petition
stands disposed of.
     Pending  application(s),  if  any,  shall  stand
disposed of.
