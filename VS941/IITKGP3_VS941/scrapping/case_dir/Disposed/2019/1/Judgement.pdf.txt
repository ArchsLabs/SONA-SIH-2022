which had inter alia issued following direction:
“… Any benefit which a candidate has secured as a
result  of  such  degrees  in  Engineering  in  the
nature of promotion or advancement in career shall
also  stand  recalled.   However,  if  any  monetary
benefit  was  derived  by  such  candidates  that
monetary  benefit  or  advantage  will  not  be
recovered  by  the  concerned  departments  or
employers.”

He further placed Order dated 14.05.2018 issued by
respondent  No.5  in  the  present  matter  [which  order  is
appended at page 209 of the paper book as Annexure P-9]
and  particularly  para  4.2  of   the  said  order.  The
direction  in  para  4.2  inter  alia,  states  that  all  the
benefits  would  be  taken  back,  (promotions,  monetary
benefit and other benefits).
 The direction as quoted above, issued by this Court
in Orissa Irrigation was clear that no monetary benefits
enjoyed pursuant to obtaining of a Degree of Engineering
from Distant Learning mode be returned or recovered.  The
respondent No.5 is therefore directed, not to recover any
monetary  benefits  which  had  been  made  over  to  the
concerned candidates.
With the aforesaid clarification, this writ petition
is disposed of.
Pending  applications,  if  any,  shall  also  stand
disposed of.
