                               O R D E R
            Delay condoned.
           Learned counsel appearing for the petitioners seeks  to  withdraw
      the petition stating that the petitioners would like to move a  review
      application before the High Court in Writ Petition No. 8780 of 2010.
           Accordingly, the special  leave  petition  is  dismissed  as  not
      pressed.
           It goes without saying that we have not expressed any opinion on
      the merits of  the  present  petition  and  as  and  when  the  review
      application is filed, the same shall be considered by the  High  Court
      on its own merits.
