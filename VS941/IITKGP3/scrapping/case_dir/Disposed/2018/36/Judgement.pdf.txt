          UPON hearing the counsel the Court made the following
                             O R D E R
There  is an inordinate delay of 1060 days in filing this
petition and moreover we are not inclined to interfere with the
impugned  judgment  and  order.   Consequently,  the  special  leave
petition stands dismissed both on the ground of delay as well as on
merits.
Pending application, if any, also stand disposed of.
