On 16.02.2018 the following order was passed:
“Permission  to  file  the  special
leave petition is granted.
Learned Attorney General has pointed
out that in view of the judgment of this
Court  in  “Bharathidasan  University  &
Anr.Vs.  All  India  Council  For  Technical
Digitally signed by

Date: 2018.04.13

 2
Education  &  Ors.”,  (2001)  8  SCC  676,  no
prior  approval  of  the  All  India  Council
for  the  Technical  Education  (AICTE)  is
required  by  the  petitioner  –  University
for starting engineering courses. 
The  petitioner  –University  is  a
State University and it gave admissions in
transparent manner only to the Government
Employees.  There  was  a  contact  programme
and faculty was available. Practical work
also  held.  DEC  gave  ex-post  facto
approval.  The  standards  have  not  been
compromised.
 It  was  also  submitted  that  upto
2005, there were no bar for such courses
being conducted even by Universities other
than  the  State  Universities.  It  is  also
stated  that  after  2009,  the  distance
education system has been closed. 
It has been suggested that it will
be necessary to hear the UGC also. 
AICTE and UGC are added as party –
respondents.
 Mr. Harish Pandey, Advocate appears
and accepts notice on behalf of AICTE and
seeks time to take instructions. 
Let  notice  be  issued  to  UGC,
returnable on 21.03.2018.
 In the meanwhile, status quo,as of
today, shall be maintained by the parties.
In  SLP(C)  No.  3755/2018,  SLP(C)  Diary  No(s).

SLP(C)Diary No(s). 3501 of 2018”.
3.
Shri  Maninder  Singh,  learned  ASG  appearing  for  the
AICTE and the UGC has drawn our attention to the judgment of
this Court in  Orissa Lift Irrigation Corporation Limited v.
Rabi Sankar Patro and Others -  2018 (1) SCC 468 inter alia
 3
laying down as follows:
“47. The AICTE is directed to devise within
one  month  from  the  date  of  this  judgment
modalities to conduct appropriate test/tests both
in  written  examination  as  well  as  in  practicals
for  the  concerned  students  admitted  during  the
academic  sessions  2001-2005  covering  all  the
concerned  subjects.  It  is  entirely  left  to  the
discretion  of  AICTE  to  come  out  with  such
modalities  as  it  may  think  appropriate  and  the
tests  in  that  behalf  shall  be  conducted  in  the
National  Institutes  of  Technology  in  respective
States  wherever  the  students  are  located.  The
choice may be given to the students to appear at
the examination which ideally should be conducted
during MayJune, 2018 or on such dates as AICTE may
determine. Not more than two chances be given to
the concerned students and if they do not pass the
test/tests their degrees shall stand recalled and
cancelled. If a particular student does not wish
to  appear  in  the  test/tests,  the  entire  money
deposited  by  such  student  towards  tuition  and
other charges shall be refunded to that student by
the  concerned  Deemed  to  be  University  within  a
month of the exercise of such option. The students
be  given  time  till  15th  of  January,  2018  to
exercise such option. The entire expenditure for
conducting the test/tests in respect of students
who wish to undergo test/tests shall be recovered
from  the  concerned  Deemed  to  be  Universities  by
31.03.2018.  If  they  clear  the  test/tests  within
the  stipulated  time,  all  the  advantages  or
benefits  shall  be  restored  to  the  concerned
candidates.  We  make  it  clear  at  the  cost  of
repetition that if the concerned candidates do not
clear the test/tests within the time stipulated or
choose  not  to  appear  at  the  test/tests,  their
degrees in Engineering through distance education
shall  stand  recalled  and  cancelled.  It  goes
without saying that any promotion or advancement
in career on the basis of such degree shall also
stand withdrawn, however any monetary benefits or
advantages in that behalf shall not be recovered
from them.
48.  As  regards  the  students  who  were  admitted
after the ex-post-facto approval granted in favour
of such Deemed to be Universities, in our view,
there  was  no  sanction  whatsoever  for  their
admission.  The  Policy  Statements  as  well  as
warnings issued from time to time were absolutely
clear. The students were admitted on the strength
 4
either provisional recognition or on the strength
of  interim  orders  passed  by  the  High  Court.  We
therefore,  declare  that  in  respect  of  students
admitted after the academic sessions of 2001-2005,
the  degrees  in  Engineering  awarded  by  the
concerned  Deemed  to  be  Universities  through
Distance Education Mode shall stand recalled and
be  treated  as  cancelled.  Any  benefit  which  a
candidate has secured as a result of such degrees
in  Engineering  in  the  nature  of  promotion  or
advancement in career shall also stand recalled.
However,  if  any  monetary  benefit  was  derived  by
such candidates that monetary benefit or advantage
will not be recovered by the concerned departments
or employers. We, further direct that the entire
amount  paid  by  such  students  to  the  concerned
Deemed to be Universities towards tuition fee and
all  other  expenditure  for  such  courses  through
distance education learning shall be returned by
the  concerned  Deemed  to  be  Universities  to  the
respective  students.  This  direction  shall  be
complied  with  by  the  concerned  Deemed  to  be
Universities scrupulously and the amounts shall be
returned by 31st of May, 2018 and an appropriate
affidavit to that extent shall be filed with UGC
within a week thereafter”.
4.
It is submitted that the norms of AICTE have to be
followed  and  distance  learning  is  not  permitted  at  all  in
technical education. Thus, even if the distinguishing feature
noted in the order issuing notice exist, the view of the High
Court is consistent with the judgment of this Court.
5.
Shri R. Venkataramani, learned senior counsel appearing
for the original writ petitioners submitted that degree to be
granted has to be the one recognized by the UGC under Section
22 of the UGC Act. It is also pointed out that under Section
6(e) of the Andhra Pradesh Education Act, 1982, norms of AICTE
are fully applicable to award of Diplomas.
6.
While we find merit in the submission of learned
counsel for the respondents  that the view taken by the High
 5
Court is correct in law, in view of distinguishing features in
the  present  case  noted  in  the  order  issuing  notice,  while
directing that norms must be followed in future, the degrees
and  diplomas  in  question  already  granted  to  candidates
admitted  up  to  academic  year  2009-2010  may  be  left
undisturbed.
To  this  extent,  the  impugned  order  stands
modified.
6.
The appeals are, accordingly, disposed of.
