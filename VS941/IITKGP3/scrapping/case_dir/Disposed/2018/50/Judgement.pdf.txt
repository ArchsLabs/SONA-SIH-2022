respondent No.6 as a Vice-Chancellor of the Sardar Patel University
was in issue and issuance of a writ of quo warranto was prayed for
by the petitioner. The appointment of the Vice-Chancellor was made
on 31.08.2016, term being three years is coming to an end by the
end of the next month.
Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  submitted  that  the
appointment was in violation of the Regulations and Schemes of the
UGC.  We  have  noticed  that  the  High  Court  itself  has  issued
observations  and  certain  directions  in  paragraph  24  of  the
judgment. 
In view of the fact that the tenure of respondent No.6 is
coming to an end by the end of next month, we are not persuaded to
entertain this special leave petition. The special leave petition
is, accordingly, dismissed leaving all questions of law open.
Pending application(s), if any, stands disposed of.
