For Respondent(s)   
          
The Court made the following
                             O R D E R
The petitioner, who appears in person, seeks some time to do
the  needful,  since  it  has  been  brought  to  his  notice  that  the
special leave petition against the dismissal of the review petition
cannot be entertained without there being a challenge to the main
order.
Faced with such a situation, the petitioner seeks permission
to withdraw these special leave petitions, without prejudice to the
liberty  to  file  appropriate  special  leave  petitions  challenging
both the orders.
The special leave petitions are, accordingly, permitted to be
withdrawn.
