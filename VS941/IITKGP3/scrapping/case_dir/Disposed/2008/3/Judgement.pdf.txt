O R D E R
Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
We find no ground to interfere with the decision of 
the High Court.
At  the  time  of  establishment  of  University,  we  are
satisfied that the UGC had no role, in case University is
created by State enactment or Central enactment.  However,it
would have the role as regulatory body/authority.   
Apart  from  that,  it  is  brought  to  our  notice  that
after making inspection, UGC has included the University in
the list of the approved University,in compliance with the
order passed by the High Court or otherwise. Be that as it
may.  Once it has been done, still role of UGC would remain
as the Regularity body/authority for which it is free to
take appropriate action in accordance with law in case it

 finds it fit in future.
Nothing  further  survives  for  adjudication  in  the
matter in view of the aforesaid factual and legal position.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.
