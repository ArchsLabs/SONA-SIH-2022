2.
It  is  not  in  dispute  that  in  view  of  the
subsequent developments, the degree obtained by the
writ petitioners (pvt. respondents herein) was duly
recognised and they had become duly qualified.  If
that  be  so,  there  is  a  duty  cast  on  the  Public
Service Commission to consider them for recruitment,
as rightly directed by the High Court.
3.
It  is  not  the  concern  of  the  Public  Service
Commission as to how the State will accommodate them
in  respect  of  the  vacancies  available  or  to  be
created.  The duty of the Public Service Commission
is only to conduct the recruitment in terms of the
request made by the appointing authority.  Once the
candidates are duly qualified, the Commission is duty
bound  under  law  to  consider  them  also  for  the
recruitment and make the appropriate recommendation.
The High Court has done only that.
4.
 It is also to be noted that the State Government
has not chosen to file any Special Leave Petition.
It  is  also  submitted  by  the  learned  counsel  that
these  appeals  have  been  filed  as  directed  by  the
State Government.  We find it difficult to appreciate
the stand taken by the State Government.

5.
The Public Service Commission is only an agency
to  make  the  recruitment.   Rest  is  for  the  State,
therefore,  the  State  cannot  bank  on  the  Public
Service  Commission  as  far  as  the  appointments  are
concerned.
6.
For all the reasons stated above, we do not find
any  merit  in  these  appeals  which  are,  accordingly,
dismissed.
Pending interlocutory applications, if any, stand
disposed of.
