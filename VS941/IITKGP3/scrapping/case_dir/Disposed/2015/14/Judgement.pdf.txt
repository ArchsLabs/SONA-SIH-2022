Reason:
                         Insofar   as    the   questions   of   law   raised   by   the
     SLP(C)No. 26223/2015 etc.                                                            1
    petitioner-University       Grants    Commission       before   the    High
    Court were concerned, they have been decided in favour of
    the petitioner.      However, in the peculiar facts of the case
    as    noted   by   the   High   Court,   relief   is    granted   to   the
    students who had undergone the distant learning courses.                We
    are not inclined to interfere with those directions passed
    by the High Court on those facts.
            The    special     leave     petitions     are,     accordingly,
    dismissed.
            Obviously, such an order would not be cited as a
    precedent in any other case.
