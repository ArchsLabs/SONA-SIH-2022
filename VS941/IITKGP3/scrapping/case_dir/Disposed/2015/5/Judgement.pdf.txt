1.
In view of the change in Regulations and the Judgment rendered
by this Court in Modern Dental College and Research Centre & Ors.
Vs.  State  of  M.P.  &  Ors.,  reported  in  (2016)  7  SCC  353,  these
matters do not survive as the law has been laid down that has been
followed.
2.
It  is  made  clear  that  for  future  admission  the  decision
rendered by this Court in Modern Dental College and Research Centre
& Ors. Vs. State of M.P. & Ors., reported in (2016) 7 SCC 353 has
to be followed. 
3.
However, we direct the college not to act in the manner it has
acted  earlier.   We  deprecate  the  admissions  which  were  made.
However, as students have passed out under the interim order, we
are not inclined to interfere in admission so made.

accordingly.

I.A. Nos.4 (Application seeking deletion of the name of
respondent Nos.14 to 22) in SLP(C) No.9457/2015 and I.A. Nos.4
(Application seeking deletion of the name of respondent Nos.14
to 19) in SLP(C) No.9506/2015 are allowed, at the risk of the
petitioners.
We  agree  with  the  High  Court  and  are  not  inclined  to
interfere with the impugned judgments and orders passed by the
High  Court.  At  the  same  time,  in  the  peculiar  facts  and
circumstances of the case, as the students had been admitted
and obtained admission in the Post Graduation Courses.  This
Court permitted the results to be declared but the same was
subject to the final decision of these petitions.
Since the result has been declared in 2015 and by now they
are  serving  as  Doctors  and  have  settled  in  their  life  and
education is such a matter which cannot be taken away and it
would  not  be  appropriate  to  take  away  the  post  graduation
qualification acquired by them as that is for the service of
the society.
In the peculiar facts and circumstances of these cases, we
are not disturbing their education and the result that has been
declared otherwise the facts of the case are so bad that they
were  not  entitled  for  any  relief  but  for  the  interim  order
passed by this Court.
However, in SLP(C) Nos.8769-8770/2015, we impose costs of
Rs.75,00,000/-  (Rupees  Seventy  Five  Lacs)  on  Mahatma  Gandhi
Medical  College and  Hospital, Jaipur,  Rajasthan, to  be paid
within one month in three equal shares of Rs.25 Lacs each to
Supreme  Court  Bar  Association,  Supreme  Court  Advocates-on-
Record  Welfare  Trust  and  Supreme  Court  Employees'  Mutual
Welfare  Fund.   Let  compliance  of  order  be  reported  to  this
5
Court within one month. 
The special leave petitions are, accordingly, disposed of.
As no action is required in the contempt petition i.e.
S.B. Civil Contempt Petition No.1060/2014, pending before the
High Court of Judicature at Rajasthan, the same is taken on
Board and is, accordingly, disposed of.
Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
