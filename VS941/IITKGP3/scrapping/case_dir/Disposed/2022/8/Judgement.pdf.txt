CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 4531 OF 2022
(@ Special Leave Petition (C) No. 10545 of 2022)
THE STATE OF MAHARASHTRA & ORS.                    Appellant(s)
                                VERSUS
DEEPAK BHAGWANRAO CHATE & ORS.                     Respondent(s)
O R D E R
Leave granted.
We  have  heard  Mr.  K.M.  Nataraj,  learned  ASG,  appearing  on
behalf  of  the  appellant-State  of  Maharashtra  and  Dr.  R.R.
Deshpande, learned counsel appearing on behalf of Respondent No.1,
who is on caveat.
Having heard the learned counsel for the respective parties
and considering the fact that the relief which is granted by the
High Court, in the impugned order, can be said to be granting a
final  relief  and  the  legality  and  validity  of  the  GR  dated
20.05.2021 is yet to be tested and considered by the High Court and
it is reported that so far as the Central Governmentâ€™s contribution
is concerned, the same has been complied with and paid, without
further  expressing  anything  on  merits  of  the  impugned  GR  dated
20.05.2021, we are of the opinion that such an interim relief which
is granted by the High Court, by way of impugned order, ought not
to have been passed by the High Court, we set aside the impugned
order passed by the High Court.

the main Writ Petition at the earliest and preferably within six

pleadings before the High Court within a period of four weeks from
