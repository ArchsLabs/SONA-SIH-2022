CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CIVIL APPEAL NO.250  /2022
   [@ SLP [C] NO.5315/2019]
SWETA @ SWETA RAJ                          Appellant(s)
VERSUS
PATNA UNIVERSITY & ORS.                    Respondent(s)
WITH
CIVIL APPEAL NO.251 /2022
[@ SLP(C) No. 9726/2019 ]
O R D E R
Leave granted.
On hearing learned counsel for the appellants, there
is no doubt that it is a hard case and the University is a
contributory to what has transpired. The UGC regulations
came  into  force  with  effect  from  11.07.2009  but  the
University  of  Bihar  adopted  the  same  only  in  November,
2012.  The period spent by the appellants in pursuing Ph.d.
degree prior to November, 2012 thus, cannot be taken into
account  as  per  the  UGC  regulations.  In  terms  of  the
impugned  order,  the  conduct  of  the  University  has  been
deprecated but that does not help the appellants.
Hard case as it may be, a mandamus would not lie to
recognize the Ph.d. degree of the appellants once the UGC
regulations have not been followed.  However, all we can
say is that the UGC in consultation with the University may

examine  if  some  methodology  can  be  found  by  asking  the
appellants to complete some bridge period and whether that
can facilitate in recognition of the Ph.d. degree of the
appellants for which the certificate has been issued by the
University but which is not as per UGC regulations.
The  needful  may  be  done  within  a  period  of  four
months from today but that would not give rise to any fresh
cause of action to the appellants.
The  appeals  accordingly  stand  dismissed  with  the
aforesaid directions.
