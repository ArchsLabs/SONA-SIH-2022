On the issue whether the services rendered with an unaided institution
could be reckoned for the purposes of service benefits including the Provident
Fund,  the  Higher  and  Technical  Education  Department,  Government  of
Maharashtra, had issued Government Resolution dated 22.11.1993 (the GR,
for short).  Clause 3 of the GR stated as under:
“3) Now the government has decided that, the employee being
retired from Non agricultural university and its affiliated Non
government recognised aided colleges and who is eligible for
pension scheme, the service of such person for the period in the
same or another college at the time when it was fully or partly
unaided be deemed as qualifying service for pensionary benefits
subject to following conditions: 
A) The unaided colleges from which the services are to be held
eligible for pensionary benefits as above should be fully
aided on the date of retirement of concerned employee.
B)
The  said  recognised,  unaided  non  government  college
should  have  been  granted  recognition  by  competent
authority of Education Department or University.
C)
In case any teacher has served in the recognised unaided
non government college and in case such service is from
above stated unaided college then it would be necessary for
such teacher to deposit the amount to the share of his
service  towards  contributory  provident  fund  along  with
interest in the government treasury. However in case where
the  management  of  concerned  college  as  per  relevant
existing rules  has  not started the contributory provident
fund account, in such case such teacher should deposit
Contributory provident fund amount from such date since
when the contributory provident fund amount should have
been deposited. However interest will not be charged on
such amount. In case the management share amount is paid
to  the  said  teacher  then  it  would  be  necessary  for  the
concerned teacher to pay per year interest at (3.1/2) three
and half percent rate on said amount for the period from the
date on which his provident fund account was reinstated till
the date of deposit of management share amount in the
government treasury.
D) In case any employee has served in Recognised, unaided
non government college and the said Service is from above
stated unaided college then it would be necessary for such
teachers to deposit the contributory provident fund amount
3
along with interest thereupon in the government treasury
which  has  been  deposited  by  the  concerned  recognised
unaided  non  government  college  management  in  their
contributory provident fund account."
5. 
The facts leading to the filing of the Contempt Petition were:- 
a) The appellant had initially worked from 1991 till 22.01.2007
with respondent no.8 College whereafter he was appointed as a
Lecturer in respondent no.1 College and his appointment was
approved by the University vide order dated 08.03.2007.
b) Respondent no.8 College was and continues to be an unaided
institution  while  respondent  no.1  College  is  a  fully  aided
institution.
c) Writ Petition No.7733 of 2011 was filed by the appellant
claiming all service benefits including those under Clause 3 of
the GR.
d) While allowing the writ petition by order dated 25.11.2014
the High Court had made following observations:
“6.
The Government Resolution dated 22.11.1993 lays
down that the services officiated in an unaided institution
can be counted for the pecuniary benefits. It lays down
that on the date when the petitioner retires. he should be
working in an aided institution. The petitioner is still in
service. He is working in aided institution is not a disputed
fact.  It  is  also  a  matter  of  record  that  the
Commissioner/Tribunal of “The Persons with Disabilities
(Equal  Opportunities,  Protection  of  Rights  and  Full
Participation) Act, 1995, has passed an order directing to
grant selection grade pay to the petitioner with all arrears.
The said order was assailed by the Management before
4
this  Court.  This  Court  dismissed  the  Writ  Petition
No.1272 of 2006 and thereafter respondent No.8 granted
selection grade pay to the petitioner. These facts are not
disputed. Even State has not challenged the order passed
by the Commissioner/Tribunal under the said Act wherein
directions were given to grant Selection Grade Pay to the
petitioner.
7.
The  Government  Resolution  dated  22.11.1993
prescribes the compliance of certain conditions. One of
the  conditions  is  with  regard  to  the  contribution  of
Provident Fund. The same is also required to be done.
8.
Considering the aforesaid aspects of the matter, we
pass the following order.
ORDER
i].
The  services  rendered  by  the
petitioner  since  23.01.1991  to
22.01.2007 with respondent No.8 shall
be  counted  for  the  purpose  of  the
selection  grade  pay  and  for  all  other
purposes. As the petitioner is possessing
the necessary qualification, the petitioner
would be entitled for the benefit of the
pay  scale  including  Selection  Grade
considering his services from 23.01.1991
as continuous service.
ii).
Needles  to  state  that  the
petitioner  will  be  entitled  for  all  the
benefits.  The  petitioner  shall  satisfy
compliance  of  Clause  3-C  of  the
Government
 
Resolution
 
dated
22.11.1993.  The  Respondents.  on
satisfaction of the same, will accord all
monetary  benefits  so  also  pensionary
benefits  as  the  petitioner  would  be
entitled.
iii).  The  respondents  shall  take  action
expeditiously  and  preferable  within  a
period of six months from today.
9.
Writ Petition is accordingly disposed of. No costs.”
e) Submitting that the aforesaid directions issued by the High
Court  were  not  being  complied  with  by  the  concerned
5
respondents, the aforementioned contempt petition was filed in
the High Court.
6.
In response, the very entitlement of the appellant was questioned. The
submission was dealt with by the High Court in its order dated 12.07.2016 as
under:
“4.
On the other hand, the learned AGP appearing for
respondent No.4, relying upon the affidavit-in-reply and
Clause 3 of the said Government Resolution, submits that
in case, the employee retires from the college, which is
partly or fully aided at the time of his retirement, then only
Clause  3C  of  the  said  Government  Resolution  can  be
invoked and pensionary benefits can be extended to the
employee. It is submitted that the Clause 3 of the said
Government Resolution will have to be read in its entirety
and it is only on fulfillment of Clause 3A, the compliance
of Clause 3C on the part of the petitioner and giving such
account number, question of depositing the amount towards
provident  fund  would  arise.  Since  the  petitioner  is  in
service and the said college is on permanent 'no grant basis'
no account number can be given to the petitioner so as to
deposit the provident fund amount. Therefore, the learned
AGP  submits  that  there  is  no  contempt  as  such  and
therefore,  the  contempt  proceedings  may  be  dropped
thereby discharging the notice issued to respondent No.4.”  
7. 
Thus, insofar as it pertained to the benefit of Provident Fund as
claimed by the appellant the contempt petition was rejected by the High Court
on 12.07.2016. The application for recall was also rejected on 06.02.2020.
8.
The High Court took the view that the services rendered with an
unaided College could be reckoned for the purposes of pensionary benefits
including  the  Provident  Fund,  only  if  at  the  time  of  retirement  of  the
concerned Teacher the institution was a fully aided institution; that the fact
that the appellant had now been working with respondent no.1, a fully aided
6
institution, would not entitle him to have the period spent in respondent no.8
institution to be reckoned for the purposes of provident fund under Clause 3
of the GR; and that since respondent no.8 Institution continued to be an
unaided institution, the appellant would not be entitled to any advantage under
said  Clause 3.
9.
Without going into the correctness of the reasoning that weighed with
the High Court, for the present purposes what is relevant to note is that in
paragraph (ii) of the operative part of its order dated 25.11.2014, the High
Court had found the appellant to be eligible for all the benefits and that upon
compliance on his part of all the requirements of Clause 3C of the GR, the
respondents were obliged to accord to him all monetary and pensionary
benefits.   
10.
While dealing with the contempt petition, in our considered view, the
High Court ought not to have gone into the correctness of the conclusions
drawn by the High Court on the earlier occasion. That order having attained
finality, the benefits in terms of said order ought to have been allowed in
favour of the appellant.
11.
We, therefore, allow these appeals, set-aside the orders under appeal
and direct:
a.
the appellant shall be provided appropriate Account
Number for the purposes of Provident Fund within four
7
weeks from today;
b. the appellant shall deposit the sums as indicated in
Clause 3(C) of the GR within four weeks thereafter;
and
c.
upon such compliance, the appellant shall be held
entitled to the benefits of the concerned Provident Fund
Scheme.
12.
With the aforesaid observations, these appeals are allowed. No costs.
