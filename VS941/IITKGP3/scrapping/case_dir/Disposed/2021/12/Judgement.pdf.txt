          UPON hearing the counsel the Court made the following
                             O R D E R
Mr.  Dushyant  Dave,  learned  senior  counsel  appeared  for
the State of Andhra Pradesh.  He informed the Court that after
re-examining the situation, the State Government has now been
well-advised  to  cancel  the  XII  standard  Examination,  to  be
conducted  by  the  concerned  State  Board.  We  place  that
statement on record. 
4
In light of this commitment made across the Bar and as we
are  informed  that  suitable  notification  is  being  issued
shortly, nothing more is required to be done in the present
proceedings. 
However, we reiterate our directions given on the earlier
occasion  to  all  State  Boards  to  ensure  that  the  internal
assessment results are declared on or before 31.07.2021, as
has been directed earlier in this petition including in the
case of Mamta Sharma Vs. Central Board of Secondary Education
& Ors. being Writ Petition(C) No. 522 of 2021. 
Since the respective States have decided to cancel the
examination, we do not wish to examine any other issue raised
in this Writ Petition, companion intervention application(s)
and other pending application(s). 
Accordingly,  the  papers  be  consigned  to  the  record  as
disposed of in the above terms.
