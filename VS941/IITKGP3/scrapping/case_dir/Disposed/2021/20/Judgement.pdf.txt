                             O R D E R
The  present  petition  filed  under  Article  32  of  the
constitution of India principally prays for following directions:
“a) Issue a Writ of Mandamus directing respondent nos.5 &
6  University  and  Controller  of  Examinations  to
conduct all examinations in B-Tech Course in all its
affiliated colleges, through online mode in light of
the COVID-19 pandemic Second Wave.

Annexures P2, P3, P5, P8 and P10 referred to in the prayers
are Circular dated 26.05.2021, Notification dated 25.06.2021, Time
Table  dated  02.07.2021,  Notification  dated  21.07.2021  and
Notification dated 26.07.2021 respectively.
All  three  petitioners  are  from  State  of  Kerala  and  they
contend that there are numerous students who are from outside the
State and that conduct of an offline examination while the State is
having the Second Wave of COVID Pandemic, may not be appropriate.
Since  the  petitioners  are  from  Kerala  and  some  of  the
identical issues are presently engaging the attention of the High
Court of Kerala, we permit the petitioners to withdraw the instant
writ  petition  with  further  liberty  to  file  an  appropriate
application before the High Court. 
Considering the urgency involved in the matter, we request the
High Court to take up such application for disposal as early as
possible  and  preferably  within  a  month  from  the  filing  of  the
application.
With the aforesaid observations, the writ petition is disposed
of as withdrawn.
Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of.
