Heard learned counsel for the parties. 
Although  diverse  reliefs  have  been  claimed,  the
principal  grievance  of  the  petitioner(s)  is  that  the
Central Board of Secondary Education (C.B.S.E) may delay
the
 
announcement
 
of
 
results
 
of
 
Class-XII
Private/Patrachar/2nd  chance  compartment  students.
Resultantly, denying the student(s) from taking admission
for higher studies. 
Learned  counsel  appearing  for  the  C.B.S.E.,  on
instructions,  stated  that  results  of  all  students
including that of Class-XII Private/Patrachar/2nd chance
compartment students will be declared before 30.09.2021
as undertaken before this Court on earlier occasion. That
position is reiterated and is being so recorded in this
order as well. 
Learned counsel for the University Grants Commission
has  pointed  out  that  even  if  the  results  are  not
available  and  admission  process  for  higher  studies
commences  before  30.09.2021,  the  petitioner(s)  and
similarly  placed  students  can  apply  for  admission  on
provisional basis, subject to producing the results that
will be declared by the C.B.S.E. on or before 30.09.2021.
The  petitioner(s)  had  apprehension  about  such
3
facility is not being made available by All India Council
for Technical Education (AICTE) for which reason we had
issued notice to AICTE. 
Learned counsel appearing for AICTE, on instructions,
submits  that  as  in  case  of  other  admissions,  the
petitioner(s) and other similarly placed students will be
permitted  to  take  provisional  admission,  subject  to
producing  the  results  declared  by  the  C.B.S.E.  before
30.09.2021. 
In  other  words,  the  petitioner(s)  can  apply  to
relevant  courses  for  pursuing  higher  studies  on
provisional  basis  and  on  giving  undertaking  that  the
results as declared by C.B.S.E. will be submitted to the
concerned  college/institution  within  one  week  from  its
issue by the C.B.S.E. 
In view of above, nothing more is required to be done
in this writ petition.  Hence, the same is disposed of. 
Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.
