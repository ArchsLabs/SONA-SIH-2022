                             O R D E R
In view of our earlier order dated 12.1.2021, we do not
find any reason to entertain the Writ Petition under Article 32 of
the Constitution of India.
However, if the petitioner has filed a representation in
the context of the Bar Council of India circular dated 27.7.2020,
in  pursuance  of  our  order  dated  12.1.2021,  we  expect  the  Bar
Council  of  India  to  pay  heed  to  the  orders  of  this  Court  and
dispose of the representation of the petitioner in accordance with
law expeditiously at its earliest convenience, preferably within a
period of four months.
Any further grievance can be pursued only under Article
226 of the Constitution of India.
Writ Petition stands disposed of. 
Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
