it is stated as follows:-
“13. In reply to para 3 I to IV, it is humbly
submitted that the Respondent University acted
on the provisions of its Act and Statutes made
there under in recognizing private educational
institutions outside the Karnataka State.  Once
the UGC objected, the University promptly acted
to  discontinue  fresh  admissions  in  all  its
collaborative  institutions.  
 Only  those
students who joined earlier to Annexure R2 are
being  continued  to  complete  the  course  for
which  they  joined/in  order  to  mitigate  their
hardship.
Lastly, it is submitted that the Out-reach
programmes  were  commenced  during  the  year
2008-09  and  thereafter  all  the  Academic
Councils,  Syndicate  and  the  Vice  Chancellors
followed them till it was objected by the UGC.
The Hon'ble Court is prayed graciously to
allow  this  Respondent  to  permit  the  students
who  had  earlier  joined  the  Out-reach  Centres
prior  to  Annexure  R2,  to  continue  their
education  and  complete  them.   It  is  assured
that  no  such  Out-reach  Programmes  will  be
encouraged  in  future  by  following  the  UGC
Guidelines...”
