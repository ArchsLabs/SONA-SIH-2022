Leave granted.
These appeals challenge the  judgment and orders dated  19-01-2016  and  26-
04-2016 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in WP No. 5677/2013 &
RP No. 44/2016 filed in  WP No. 5677/2013  respectively.
The basic issue which arose for consideration was whether the appellants were
entitled to extension in the age of superannuation from 62 to 65 years.
After having ruled against the appellants, the directions issued by the High
Court in Paragraph 43 of its judgment were as under:
     “43.
..…
(A)
Rule is made absolute in Writ Petition No.3481 of 2015 in terms of
prayer clauses (B) and (BB).  The decision of the Performance Review Committee
dated 14th June, 2013 and the order of the State Government dated 29th November,
2013, are hereby set aside.
(B)
The Civil Application No.3395 of 2015 in Writ Petition No.3481 of
2015 is disposed of in the aforesaid terms;
(c)Rule is discharged in Writ Petition Nos. 986 of 2013, 5677 of 2013, 5678 of
2013, 5679 of 2013, 6164 of 2013,  9820 of 2013, 9821 of 2013, 12051 of 2012,
12052 of 2012 and 12056 of 2012 and Civil Application No.693 of 2015 in Writ
Petition No.5677 of 2013 and Civil Application No.2762 of 2013 in Writ Petition
No.9820 of 2013 are also disposed of in the aforesaid terms.  The interim orders
granted in these petitions stand vacated.
3
(d)The Petitioners-Principals, in the petitions referred in clause (C) above, are
directed to refund to the State Government all the financial benefits like salary
etc.  obtained by them in respect of their continuance in service beyond the age of
62  years  within  a  period  of  three  months  from  today.   In  case,  the  State
Government or the Institutions in which the Petitioners-Principals have served
are due and payable any amounts towards terminal benefits etc., then the State
Government  and/or  the  Institutions  shall  be  entitled  to  make  appropriate
deduction/adjustment,   so  that  excess  amounts  received  by  the  Petitioners-
Principals are recovered by the State Government.  It is made clear that the
excess amounts must ultimately be refunded to the State Government within a
period of three months from today;
(E)
All the Petitioners-Principals,  shall not be entitled to count their
services beyond the age of 62 years either for the purposes of retiral benefits or
for any purpose whatsoever,  since it is declared that their continuance beyond
the age of 62 years was illegal.  
(F)
All the Petitioners,  except the Petitioner in Writ Petition No.3481 of
2015 shall pay cost quantified at Rs.10,000/- each in favour of the State of
Maharashtra.
(G)
All the writ petitions stand disposed of finally in the aforesaid terms.”
The issuance of notice by this Court in these matters was restricted to the issue
of refund and adverse observation(s).
It is a matter of record that the appellants worked as Principals in the respective
institutions and have now retired after attaining the age of 65 years.
Heard Mr. B.H. Marlapalle, learned Senior Advocate assisted  by Mr. Dilip
Annasaheb Taur, learned advocate for the appellant, Mr.  Vinay Navare, learned Senior
Advocate for the Management and Mr. Rahul Chitnis, learned Advocate for the State.
Since  the  appellants  had  actually  worked  and  discharged  their  duties  as
Principals, in our view,  in the peculiar facts and circumstances, there ought not to be
any direction to recover the financial benefits enjoyed by the appellants beyond the
age of 62 years.
We, therefore, have no hesitation in setting aside the direction(s) issued by the
4
High Court in sub-paras (D) and (E) of paragraph 43.
The instant appeals,  therefore, are allowed to the  extent  indicated above,
without any order as to costs. 
Civil Appeal  No(s). 7415-7416 /2021
(Arising out of SLP(C)  No(s).13985-13986/2016)
Leave granted.
These appeals challenge the  judgment and orders dated  19-01-2016 passed by
the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in WP No. 3481/2015 & Writ Petition
No.9820/2013.
Heard Mr. Sudhanshu S. Choudhary, learned advocate in support of the appeal
and Mr. Rahul Chitnis, learned counsel for the State and Mr. Vinay Navare, learned
Senior Advocate for the management. 
The  facts  and circumstances  in  the  instant  case  are  identical  to the  facts
mentioned in Civil Appeals (Arising out of SLP(C) No(s).25697-25698/2016) except
for an additional feature that the appellants did not have Ph.D qualifications and
according to the High Court they had fraudulently secured interim orders by indulging
in suppression. With the assistance of the learned counsel, we have gone through the
relevant documents. The fact that they did not have the requisite qualification was
clearly to the knowledge of all the concerned and yet the appellants were appointed as
Principals. The appellants cannot therefore be said to have secured any interim orders
from the High Court fraudulently. 
For the reasons stated in the earlier order, these appeals are allowed in terms as
indicated  in said order.
5
The appeals are allowed accordingly without any order as to costs.

indicated in the aforesaid order.
The appeals are allowed accordingly without any order as to costs.
