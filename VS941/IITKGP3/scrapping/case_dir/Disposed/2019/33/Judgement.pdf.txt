          UPON hearing the counsel the Court made the following
                             O R D E R
We have heard learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of
the petitioner and perused the impugned judgment and materials on
record.
This  special  leave  petition  has  been  preferred  against  the
order dismissing impleading petition filed by the petitioner in the
writ  appeal.  The  petitioner  was  not  party  in  the  writ  petition
before the learned Single Judge nor taken steps to implead himself
in  the  writ  petition.  Hence,  we  do  not  find  any  merit  in  this
special leave petition. The special leave petition is, accordingly,
dismissed.
Pending application(s),if any, shall also stand disposed of.
