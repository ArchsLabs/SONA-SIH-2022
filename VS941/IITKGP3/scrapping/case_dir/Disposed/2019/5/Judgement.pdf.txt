O R D E R
Application for listing Review Petition (C) No.510 of 2019 in open Court is
rejected.
Grounds in the review petitions were also raised and gone into when the special
leave petitions were considered by this Court.  The decision rendered by the High
Court was found to be correct and the special leave petitions were dismissed.  The
Court  also  noted  that  similar  challenge  raised  on  behalf  of  certain  individual
petitioners had also been rejected earlier.  Taking totality of the circumstances, the
submissions raised by the University Grants Commission and the Union of India were
not accepted and the petitions were dismissed.

We have gone through the review petitions and do not find any error apparent
on record to justify interference in review jurisdiction. 
These review petitions are, therefore, dismissed.
